# Products_REST_API-Project
Introduction Backend development is typically the first step after the planning phase of the creation of a new application. The frontend application is dependent on the backend serverâ€™s data and functionality. This is an exercise of building a backend Web API prior to the start of the frontend of the application. We will be testing and interacting with this backend Web API using Postman to ensure everything is working as expected. This will also help us visualize what the structure of the data will be that the frontend will be consuming. Learning Objectives Understand how to build a Web API for a full-stack application with database integration. Task Create a Django REST API connected to a MySQL database allowing a frontend application to POST comments and replies to the MySQL database relative to the video the user is currently watching.
